# NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis


The objective of this project was to design a robust data infrastructure and provide valuable insights to support key business decisions. The dataset was used from NYC open data website  and it had 4 files - collisions, crashes, vehicle and persons with over 2 millions rows

Tasks- 
	Dimensional Model Design: I designed a multi-star schema dimensional model, which included 7 fact tables and 26 dimension tables using Alteryx. 
	Data Profiling and Cleansing: To ensure the quality of the data, I conducted thorough data profiling and cleansing. I used SQL queries to identify and rectify data anomalies, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies as part of the data quality check. Like valid age, year also handled missing values. Travel direction use full form. If the collision date is a future date then it incorrect so replace it with a dummy value like 1999. For age it cannot be negative, also it canâ€™t be greater than 120.
	ETL Workflow: I utilized Talend to create a comprehensive ETL workflow that loaded all the tables in a scheduled and automated manner. This ETL process was orchestrated through a single master job for efficiency.
	Data Visualization: To provide meaningful insights, I established data visualization using Power BI and Tableau. Specifically, I created visualizations that showcased the places where most Collisions happened or time where most collisions happened.

Results-The project resulted in several significant outcomes:
A well-structured multi-star schema dimensional model was created
The ETL workflow, coordinated through a single master job, improved data loading efficiency
The visualization of the top 1000 collisions using Power BI and Tableau enhanced decision-making by providing clear and actionable insights to stakeholders.
